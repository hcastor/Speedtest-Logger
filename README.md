# Speedtest-Logger
This script logs speedtest results to a text file. It is to be setup as a cron job, and run every x minutes. I set mine up with windows event manager, and ran it every 20 minutes. 

# Why?
I lived in an apartment complex that was managed so poorly. I wont go into details but their internet was unusable from the hours 4pm - 2am. Literally every day like clockwork. Being a computer science major and basically everything I do requiring internet connection, this was not acceptable. The management pretended like it wasn't a problem on their end, and it was something with my router. I knew this not to be the case, so I created this script to take a speed test every 20 minutes, to show them that the ping would be absurdly high for over 8 hours a day. The most import 8 hours a day for a college student mind you. This effectivly meant I didnt have internet for months. They still did not fix the internet, but I got of my lease early for compounding reasons anyway. You can see the results I gave them in the results.pdf. The first graph is the ping over a single day, highlighting the bad hours. The second graph is a graph of all the speed tests I had ever taken since move in date.
